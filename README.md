# Word Statistics

The program is used to perform various word statistics of a given document (as a string).

## How do I demo the project?

This project was developed with compability in mind. All logic for the program executes on the client machine and requires no external API to function. Additionally, a demo page is available
at [/build/dist/index.html](build/dist/index.html). The demo page has all CSS, HTML, & JavaScript bundled within the same file. Note that the default React favicon will not load.

To run the demo page:

1. View the raw text of [/build/dist/index.html](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/camcamfresh/word-statistics/main/build/dist/index.html)
2. Right click on the page and save the file anywhere on your machine as index.html.
3. Open the file in any browser.
